> The instances from the EJOR paper contain faulty data.
> The correct in `instances/` were obtained by email from Artur Pessoa directly.

- `bks.txt`: best known solutions obtained from Pessoa et al. (2018) and Queiroga (2021).
- `instances/`: correct HFVRP instances used in Pessoa et al. (2018) for the instances, obtained via email. 
  - The original X143-FSMF instance contains the wrong number of vehicles, which were zero for each vehicle type. This is changed to 142 for each vehicle as per the unlimited fleet problem characteristic.
